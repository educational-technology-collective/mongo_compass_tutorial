# mongo_compass_tutorial

## Description

This is a guide to installing MongoDB Compass and connecting to the Nellodee remote server. As well as a brief overview of some simple mongo queries using the Compass GUI.


## Installation 

Navigate to [Install MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/compass/master/install/) <br>
Choose the version corresponding to your operating system.

You shouldn't need to install MongoDB itself to connect to a remote instance of MongoDB but I will leave the link to install MongoDB on your local system here: [Install MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/) <br>
If you want to run/test/use MongoDB on your local system, you will need to follow the steps on the link above and make sure you choose the <b>Community Edition</b> corresponding to your operating system.
